tetris.j
========

The classic tetris game implemented in [J](http://jsoftware.com/).  Fairly featureful:

- hjkl to move/rotate/drop faster.
- space to instant drop
- colors
- score
- drop speed increases as score goes up

To run, just copy/paste one of the .j files into jconsole, (download [here](http://jsoftware.com/stable.htm)).  I've only tested in 602; not sure if 701 will work.

There are three versions:

- tetris.j is the original, fairly clean version
- tetris.oneline.j is compacted to be a single (giant) function
- tetris.min.j is a semi-manually "minified" version that aims for compactness.

All should behave identically.
